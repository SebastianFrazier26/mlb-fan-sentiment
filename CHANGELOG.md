# Changelog

## 2026-10-12

- Name matching is accent-insensitive in both directions (`Alcantara` = `Alcántara`);
  folding is length-preserving so match offsets stay valid.
- First-name-collision guard: a bare surname that is also a common first name
  (`Anthony` for Roman Anthony) is not credited when directly followed by a capitalized
  word outside the player's own name (`Anthony Volpe`). Known limitation: a sentence
  start after the name (`Anthony Then homered`) is dropped too.
- New `fansent.names.name_pattern(...)` (accent folding + optional guard) for alias layers;
  `build_matchers` now returns pattern-like objects with `.search()` instead of `re.Pattern`.
- New `fansent.first_names.COMMON_FIRST_NAMES`; roster first names are added at build time.

## 2026-10-01

- Split data collectors (`reddit-dump`, `reddit-live`, `news`) into the private
  `fansent-collect` repo; `fansent` keeps `rosters`, `stats`, `score`, `correlate`
  and consumes the collectors' `texts.csv` / `news_tone.csv`.
- Dropped `zstandard` dependency and the `live` (praw) extra; declared `numpy` explicitly.
- Licensed under Apache-2.0.
- Committed `uv.lock`; bumped urllib3 2.7.0 -> 2.8.0 (pip-audit: PYSEC-2026-4175/4176/4177).
- Added GitHub Actions CI: ruff check, ruff format check, pytest, pip-audit.
- Applied `ruff format` across the codebase.
- Added `CLAUDE.md` agent guide.
